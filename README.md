From June to August 2019, I was one of 5000 selected worldwide to participate to the Secure & Private AI challenge, on the basis of my AI contributions. I learned how to leverage PySyft and Federated learning for private and secure machine learning. This repository contains all the codes used during the course.

I highly encouraged every AI practitioner to learn how to ensure privacy of data during in Artificial Intelligence.
